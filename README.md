# Project Overview  
In epidemiology, incidence is a measure of the probability of occurrence of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time.

The aim of this project is to explore the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cancer dataset to uncover potential incidence patterns of lung and bronchus cancer within the United States from 2015 through 2019. Here, we examine the relationships between demographic categories (race/ethnicity and gender), place of residence, and diagnoses of cancer derived from the data.
